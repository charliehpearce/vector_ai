# CNN Training and Deployment

A little project for training a neural network on the Fashion MNST dataset in PyTorch and deploying with a message broker (Google Pubsub/Kafka).

Scripts relating to training and tuning a CNN can be found in `NN/`, a unified Kafka PubSub API can be found in `kafka-pubsub/` and deployment with Kafka can be found in `deploy/`.
